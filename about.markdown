Hi, I am Hau Hsu. I am a software engineer in Taiwan.

I found that writing is a great way for learning, sharing, and recording.  
So I created this blog to write things down.  

The posts might be written in both English and Mandarin.  
Technical articles are mainly written in English.  
Diary-like articles would be written in Chinese.
